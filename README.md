# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Summary
We created a binary classifier to determine if applicants would be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.


## Results
We considered IS_SUCCESSFUL as our target variable and all other columns as our feature variables besides EIN and Name.
The variables removed from the dataset were EIN and Name.

I added two layers for training our model as instructed by the challenge. I got close to achieving the model performance where my highest result was 65%. The model now reads 63% because I changed the classification value counts < value from 400 to 375. The model had the best performance at less than 400 for classification value counts. I started at 500 which only had a score of around 50%.
